## 🗃️ Database Schema

```sql
-- Default user (pre-seeded, no login required)
users (id, name, username, email, avatar, timezone, created_at)

-- Event types with unique slugs for public URLs
event_types (id, user_id, title, slug, description, duration, location, color, is_active, created_at)

-- Availability schedule (default working hours)
availability (id, user_id, name, timezone, is_default, created_at)

-- Per-day settings within an availability schedule
availability_days (id, availability_id, day_of_week, is_enabled, start_time, end_time)

-- Individual bookings with conflict prevention
bookings (id, event_type_id, user_id, booker_name, booker_email, start_time, end_time, status, notes, uid, created_at)
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **`uid` on bookings**: A unique random identifier for each booking, used in confirmation URLs (avoids exposing auto-increment IDs)
- **`availability_days` table**: Stores per-day availability separately, allowing fine-grained control per weekday
- **`is_active` on event_types**: Soft-disable without deleting — bookers see a 404 for disabled events
- **SQLite with WAL mode**: Enables concurrent reads, safe for development and single-server production

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18
- npm ≥ 9

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd schedulo
npm install
```

### 2. Run in development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:3000**

The SQLite database is auto-created at `data/schedulo.db` on first run, and seeded with:
- 4 event types (15min, 30min, 1hour, product-demo)
- Default availability (Mon–Fri 9AM–5PM, America/New_York)
- 6 sample bookings (3 upcoming, 2 past, 1 cancelled)

### 3. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🎨 UI Design

The application closely replicates Cal.com's design language:

- **Color palette**: Clean whites, light gray backgrounds (`#f3f4f6`), near-black text (`#111827`)
- **Typography**: Inter font — same as Cal.com
- **Layout**: Fixed sidebar (240px) + scrollable main content
- **Components**: Cards with color-bar accents, smooth toggle switches, tab navigation, inline time pickers
- **Public booking page**: Two-panel layout (event info left, calendar right) — identical to Cal.com

## ⚙️ Assumptions

1. **Flexible User Identification**: The system allows signing in as a default "Admin" or with a custom email to receive booking notifications.
2. **Server-side SQLite**: `better-sqlite3` runs synchronously in Node.js API routes. This works great in development and single-instance deployments.
3. **Timezone display only**: Timezone is stored and displayed but not used to convert UTC slot times yet (slots are local server time).
4. **Email notifications**: Automatic booking confirmation and admin notification emails are sent using Gmail via Nodemailer.
5. **Date seeding**: Sample booking dates are seeded relative to the current date at first run.
